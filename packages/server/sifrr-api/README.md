# sifrr-api

Opinioted way of creating normal apis or GraphQL apis using these amazing libraries:

- [graphql](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js)
- [sequelize](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize)
- [graphql-sequelize](https://github.com/mickhansen/graphql-sequelize)
- [graphql-tools](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tools)

- This library is mainly to make development of graphQL APIs easier, avoiding manually creating schema/resolvers.
- Serving graphQL query results easily in route based APIs.
- Serve both type of APIs at once without duplicating most of the code.
